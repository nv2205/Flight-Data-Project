# Flight-Data-Project

## Dataset
Almost all of us have the experience of being stuck in an airport because our flight was delayed or canceled. As a person who knows how to analyze data, we all wondered if we could have predicted it if we had access <b>to</b>  the data. This is the chance to find out.

In this project, I will perform some analysis on a flight delay dataset. This dataset is provided by the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) which tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. In the following, you can find the definition of some of the features in this dataset.

<b>Airline delay.</b> 
This type of delay pertains to the status within the airlineâ€™s control. For example, problems with maintenance and crew, cleaning within the cabin, fueling, and baggage loading could all be contributing factors to a delayed flight. 

<b>Security delay.</b> 
Security delay is caused by evacuation of a terminal or concourse, re-boarding of an aircraft because of a security breach, inoperative screening equipment, and/or long lines in excess of 29 minutes at screening areas.

<b>Weather delay.</b> 
Weather delay is caused by extreme or hazardous weather conditions that are forecasted or manifest themselves on point of departure, enroute, or on point of arrival.

<b>Late aircraft delay.</b> 
Arrival delay at an airport due to the late arrival of the same aircraft at a previous airport. The ripple effect of an earlier delay at downstream airports is referred to as delay propagation.

<b>Taxi in/out.</b> 
Taxi time is the total time of an aircraft's movement on the ground.

<b>Wheels-off.</b> 
The time that an aircraft lifts off from the origin airport.
    
<b>Wheels-on.</b> 
 The time that an aircraft lands at the designated airport.

<b> Air time.</b> 
The time from the moment an aircraft leaves the surface until it comes into contact with the surface at the next point of landing.
